10) 	We calculated all edge-costs and new vertices as shown in the paper. We wrote
	a single new function that calculates Kp matrices for both vertices of given edge, 
	summing them together to get Q1, Q2 respectively, and then summed them togather to get
	Q=Q1+Q2. We then solved the linear equation system shown in the paper to get the optimal
	new vertex v, and calculated v^T*Q*v to get the cost of the change. We calculated the
	normals for the calculations of Kps inside this function for the sake of encapsulation.
	
11)	Our collapse edge function similar to the original one, exept for the added printing.
	We didn't need to change more things since all the logic happens in our cost function,
	as we mantioned.
